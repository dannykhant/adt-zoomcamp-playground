### MCP

- Model Context Protocol
- Open standard to build two way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools
- Why MCP?
    - Before MCP, we need to expose API for each of the data sources to LLM
        - Data source connectors (Github, Slack, etc…) ⇒ Unique API ⇒ LLM
    - After MCP
        - Connectors ⇒ Unique API ⇒ MCP ⇒ Unified API ⇒ LLM
- MCP Integrations
    - IDE (LLM + MCP client)  ← JSON RPC →(Github, Slack, Airflow, etc…)
- MCP Architecture
    - MCP Host
        - AI application that manages multiple clients
    - MCP Client
        - Client that maintains connection to MCP server and get context from MCP server for the MCP host to use
    - MCP Server
        - Program that provides context to MCP clients
    - Architecture
        - MCP Host (MCP Client) ← JSON-RPC → MCP Server ⇒  API
- MCP Primitives
    - Notifications
    - Server
        - Tools
        - Resources
        - Prompts
    - Client
        - Sampling
        - Roots
        - Elicitation
- Server Primitives
    - Tools
        - Model controls it
        - Example
            - Search flights, send messages, create calendar events
    - Resources
        - Application controls it
        - Example
            - Retrieve documents, access knowledge bases, read calendars
    - Prompts
        - User controls it
        - Example
            - Plan a vacation, summarize my meetings, draft an email
- Client Primitives
    - Sampling
        - Handing off LLM calling to client
        - It’s like - asking LLM to book a flight and then LLM comes back with a few questions for user like your name, your other info, etc…
    - Roots
        - Read specific files
    - Elicitation
        - Ask user details
- MCP Communication
    - MCP use JSON to communicate
    - JSON can be sent by following ways
        - Stdio
        - Streamable HTTP
- Stdio
    - MCP client → [ stdin → MCP server ]
    - [ MCP server → stdout ] → MCP client
- Streamable HTTP
    - Client → Call tool POST request → Server
    - Server → SSE response → Client

### MCP + Dev Workflow

- Context7
    - MCP server for documentations
- copilot-instructions.md
    - A special Markdown file used to provide custom, contextual instructions to GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code
- Hashnode
    - Blogging platform for developers
